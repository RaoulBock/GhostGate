# Secure Exchange Tunnel 🔐🌍

A lightweight Node.js utility that *securely proxies local or internal HTTPS services* and exposes them to the internet using *TunnelMole*.  
Perfect for *testing webhooks, **sharing internal dashboards, or **exposing services behind firewalls* without complex configuration.

This project provides *two ways to run the tunnel*:
- A *simple fixed configuration* (tunnel.js)
- A *flexible CLI-based tool* (secure-exchange.js)

## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1: tunnel.js (Simple & Fixed Configuration)

Use this option when you have *one known internal service* and want minimal setup.

#### 1. Configure

Edit tunnel.js and update the values below:

```js
const PORT = 1234;

target: https://example.domain.local:1234
host: example.domain.local
```

#### 2. Run

```js

node tunne.js
```

#### 2. Output Example

```bash
🔁 Proxy running on http://localhost:1234 -> https://example.domain.local:1234
https://random-name.tunnelmole.net
```

You can now access your internal service using the generated TunnelMole URL

### Option 2: secure-exchange.js (CLI-Based – Recommended)

This option is more flexible and ideal for scripts, automation, or multiple environments.

#### 1. (Optional) Make Executable

```bash
chmod +x secure-exchange.js
```

#### 2. Run with Arguments

```bash
node secure-exchange.js \
  --target https://internal.service.local:8443 \
  --host internal.service.local \
  --port 3000
```
